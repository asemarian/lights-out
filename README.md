# Lights Out
A web version of the classic Lights Out game. The game consists of a 5x5 grid of lights. Pressing a light toggles all the lights adjacent to it (above, below, to the right, and to the left of it). The goal is simple: turn off all the lights! For more information, check out this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_%28game%29).

## Implementation

I used React to implement this game. I referenced this [paper](https://ida.mtholyoke.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10166/693/375.pdf?sequence=1) to ensure that the patterns generated are solvable. Also: it's responsive, so you can play on your phone, too. Click here to go to the [live version](https://asemarian.github.io/lights-out/).

## Install

Go to the master branch first, then download or clone the repo. You need to start a local server to run the game.
